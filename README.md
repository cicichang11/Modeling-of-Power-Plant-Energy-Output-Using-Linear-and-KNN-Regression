# Modeling-of-Power-Plant-Energy-Output-Using-Linear-and-KNN-Regression
The project presents an in-depth analysis of the Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set, spanning from 2006 to 2011. This study aims to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) using ambient variables like Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), and Exhaust Vacuum (V).
